## Method
Content was created with R code and markdown that was put into files in "Rmd" format and then "html" files were generated from RStudio.

## Overview
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”

2. “Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions”

In the simple regression model it was shown that a manual transmission achieves 7.245 mpg better than an automatic transmission.

In the multivariable regression model it was shown that a manual transmission accounts for 1.80921 mpg of the improvement over an automatic transmission. Other factors namely the number of cylinders, horse power and weight were shown to have a significant impact on mpg.
